# [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)](index.html) training

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/blob/master/labml_nn/diffusion/ddpm/experiment.ipynb)

This trains a DDPM based model on CelebA HQ dataset. You can find the download instruction in this
[discussion on fast.ai](https://forums.fast.ai/t/download-celeba-hq-dataset/45873/3).
Save the images inside [`data/celebA` folder](#dataset_path).

The paper had used a exponential moving average of the model with a decay of $0.9999$. We have skipped this for
simplicity.
